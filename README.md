Proof Of Concept Code
=====================

A small multi-language reference library for implementing code paradigms and grammar.

Everyone has their preferred styles of coding, but we also learn new styles as we grow (regardless of language).
Maybe it's to innovate a new solution to an existing problem, or maybe it's required for the job,
or maybe you're just trying to expand your own expressive ability.

Regardless, it's a general best practice to "scout out" samples of any new style or approach and see if the
compiler or interpreter even accepts them in the first place. It's one thing to understand the main grammar
points of a new style, it's another to put it into practice. It's the worst when you innovate something new you're
proud of, only to find out after much framework building the compiler rejects your idea in the first place.
I come from the school of hard knocks in this regard unfortunately.

This small library provides those basic prototyping samples---ones of innovations which actually work.
They are largely for reference so I don't have to go digging through old code to find out again how I did it before.
Sometimes you can find similar solutions on Stack Overflow, but not always.

Lastly, though the exact examples are personal, I figure this is also a reasonable resource to add to my portfolio,
so I will do my best to also document and explain the code within.

Thank you.
